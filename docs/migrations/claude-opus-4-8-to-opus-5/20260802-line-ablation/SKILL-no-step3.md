# Model Corrections

Your model has some misunderstandings of TDD, which you should override with the following:

## Always Write the Test First

1. The test should always be written before any production code change, but don't run the test yet.
2. After the test is written, then change the production code so it [fails for the right reason](#failing-for-the-right-reason)

## Failing for the Right Reason

A test fails for the right reason when:
- It has an assertion failure where the actual result is not matching the expected result and
- Where values are being compared in the assertion, the returned value must be of the same type.

## Making a Test Pass

Make a failing test pass using 'Fake-It'.
